# Conflicts management

This micro-service is part of the backend architecture of the dataESR project.
Its purpose is to help the administrator updating the main database **dataESR** with distant source databases by dealing with conflictual cases.

## Dependencies

You will need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and  [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Getting Started

First, clone the project, install dependencies and check that it works

```bash
$ make install      # Install the pip dependencies on the docker container
$ make start        # Run the container containing your local python server
```
If everything works, you should see the available routes [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/application/spec).


## Commands

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `make start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`make <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`install`|Install the pip dependencies on the server's container.|
|`start`|Run your local server in its own docker container.|
|`daemon`|Run your local server in its own docker container as a daemon.|
|`db/connect`|Connect to your docker database.|
|`db/migrate`|Generate a database migration file using alembic, based on your model files.|
|`db/upgrade`|Run the migrations until your database is up to date.|
|`db/downgrade`|Downgrade your database by one migration.|
|`tests`|Run unit tests with unittest in its own container.|
|`lint`|Run flake8 on the `src` directory.|
